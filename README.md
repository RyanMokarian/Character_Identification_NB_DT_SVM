# Character_Identification_NB_DT_SVM
Character Identification using Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine from Scikit-learn

'''
    The following 3 Machine Learning algorithms run on 2 datasets, located in "DataSet_Release 2" folder.
        1. Decision Tree (DT)
        2. Naive Bayes classifier (NB) - BernoulliNB
        3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    Datasets located in "DataSet_Release 2" folder.
    Dataset 1 contains images of the 26 uppercase letters [A – Z] and 25 lowercase letters [a – z]
    Dataset 2 contains images of 10 Greek letters.
    The program generates one output file for each of the 3 models and each of the validation and test sets.
